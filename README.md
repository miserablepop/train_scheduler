# Train Scheduler

## About

The Train Scheduler app will allow a user to enter a train's information:

-- Train Name
-- Train Desintation
-- First Train Time
-- Frequency of Train

With this information, the train will be added to the scheduler for the user to see updated information and calculated data like: 

-- Next train arrival 
-- How many minutes until the current train arrives.


## Few important items

1) First train time must be in military time (HH:mm).

2) User must enter every item in the Add a train section. If a value is missed, the user will be notified to enter that value before submission will complete.

3) The latest train entered will appear at the top of the train schedule table.
